Pipeworks note: Currently you can pipe items inside the storage interface but you can't pipe them out because of the pipeworks api.

How to use it: Place the Storage Interface next to your chests and right click the Storage Interface.  (The chests have to border on each other. If they don't you can connect them with Storage Connectors.)
If you want to change the destination of your items you can use the Sorting Filter Inscribing Tool.
